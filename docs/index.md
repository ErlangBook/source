ElixirBook is an attempt to write a beginner friendly book about [**Elixir**](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [**Phoenix**](http://phoenixframework.org/), which I write to better memorize things myself, because I heard that writing about something is the best way to learn and memorize something better.

You can find the source code for this book at GitHub:
