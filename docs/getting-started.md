Assuming you already installed Erlang and Elixir, you can run Interactive Elixir Shell (iex) inside your terminal/command line.

!!! info "Opening command line / terminal (skip if you already know)"
    On Mac, open terminal by pressing `âŒ˜` + `space` and then typing `terminal` to find it. On windows click on the start button and the type `cmd` to open command prompt. On Ubuntu press `ctrl` + `alt` + `t` to open terminal.

## Interactive Elixir
Open command line / terminal, type iex and press enter. It will output the Erlang and Elixir versions and the prompot will change to `iex(1)>`. The number will change every time you execute a new command.

IEx is a [repl (Read-Eval-Print Loop)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop), it will take a single input, evaluate it and return the result. We can tell it to return some [string](https://techterms.com/definition/string), we can add, subtract, divide and multiply two or more than two numbers and get the result back. We can run elixir's built-in functions inside iex, or we can even write our own functions and modules inside iex, we can also run functions written in some file from iex. A single command we enter iex is called an expression.

Let's open iex and enter the following expressions.

``` elixir
iex(1)> 1 + 2
3
iex(2)> 5 - 3
2
iex(3)> 2 + 2 == 4
true
iex(4)> 3 * 3 == 10
false
iex(5)> 3 + 5 != 20
true
iex(6)>  8 > 3
true
iex(7)> 2 + 2 > 3
true
iex(8)> length [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
9
iex(9)> Float.floor(15.3373, 2)
15.33
iex(10)> Calendar.ISO.leap_year?(2018)
false
iex(11)> Calendar.ISO.leap_year?(2020)
true
```

The last 4 expressions need explanation
