## History of Elixir

In 2010, a very influential rubyist and Rails core team member José Valim started using Erlang for pieces of his Rails apps with higher need for better concurrency. But he missed some features in Erlang, so he decided to create a new programming language which wil run on Erlang VM (BEAM).

On Jan 9, 2011 José Valim initialized a new git repository for this language and called it Elixir.

## About the language

Elixir is a functional, dynamic language designed for easier scalability and maintainability. It runs on Erlang VM which is refined and battle tested for decades. Scalability, concurrency, fault-tolernace and hot code reloading are some of the strengths of the Erlang VM (BEAM).
